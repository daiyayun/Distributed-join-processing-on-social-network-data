# INF442_Projet

The goal of this project is to develop programs that process so-called
join queries, one of the most important classes of database queries, in a
distributed fashion.

in folder code:
Graph.hpp: defined a class Graph for a relation and related methods
Graph.cpp: the implementations of the methods
mpi_join.cpp: the methods that use MPI
all the rest are test programs

in folder code_v:
a older version of our codes that use a two-dimensional vector for a relation
